# Sports-Games-Tracker

This goal of this project is to take in information about sporting events I have attended and return information about the games and players I have seen.  

## General Project Update:
- Takes in my sports attended CSV and separates them by major sport league
- Currently working on NBA games as my starting point, will move on to MLB afterward, then likely either NCAA football, basketball, and baseball. Priority will be determined by the amount of games I have attended for the sake of having good dinner.

## All Events Progress Updates
- Created DataFrame showing how many teams in a professional league I have seen play, as well as amount of stadiums/arenas I have been to
